This is a web application designed to calculate car leasing costs. The application features a dynamic calculator, meaning any changes made to the options are immediately reflected in the details section. The details section is divided into two segments. The first segment shows the total leasing cost and the down payment selected by the user. The second segment displays the monthly installments for the chosen period and the yearly interest rate. The calculator includes four inputs. The first input is a dropdown menu where the user can choose the car type (brand new or used), which determines the yearly interest rate. The second input is also a dropdown menu, listing all available leasing periods. The third and fourth inputs are range sliders combined with text inputs. The first pair sets the car's value, and the second pair determines the desired down payment amount.
